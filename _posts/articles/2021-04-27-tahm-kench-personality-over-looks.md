<p> As we all know, winter is approaching at a faster rate than most of us would like (unless you‚Äôre one of those few people who can stand the cold). This means that cuffing season is once again coming up and oh boy, ONE of you reading this article right now may just end up with the HAPPIEST winter you have EVER experienced.

<p> Introducing....  
<p style="font-size:40px;"><strong> Tahm Kench, the River King </strong>  
<p> <em> _"Call me king, call me demon - water forgets the names of the drowned." </em>_

<p> Tahm Kench... the king of everyone's dreams.  
<p> The demonic chef with a charming persona, holding the Guinness World Record for the longest and thickest tongue.

And if that somehow doesn‚Äôt persuade you, you will certainly fall in love with him on an abyssal voyage. So now that you‚Äôre interested, here is some very normal and helpful background information about him.
