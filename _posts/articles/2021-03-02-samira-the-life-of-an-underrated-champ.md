## Samira - The Desert Rose

_“Samira stares death in the eye with unyielding confidence, seeking thrill wherever she goes. After her Shuriman home was destroyed as a child, Samira found her true calling in Noxus, where she built a reputation as a stylish daredevil taking on dangerous missions of the highest caliber. Wielding black-powder pistols and a custom-engineered blade, Samira thrives in life-or-death circumstances, eliminating any who stand in her way with flash and flair.”_

21st September 2020: A true work of art was born. A champion of the highest calibre. By far, one of the greatest characters to ever grace the Rift. Riot games finally did something right… until they ruined it all.

In the span of five months since her release, this beautiful and underrated champion has been nerfed and hotfixed and nerfed again and changed over and over and over for absolutely no reason. Samira has had:

* 1 hotfix (immediately after release, mind you)
* 2 bug fixes
* 3 undocumented changes
* And 7 nerfs all round!

Like… Rito… Come on, that's not fair. No champion should need to be nerfed this hard. Samira was perfectly fine upon her release, and there was nothing to warrant such injustice.

So what, if she could destroy all incoming projectiles?  
So what, if she could apply 100% life steal effectiveness on abilities? And 100 to 0 a champion in a matter of seconds? And knock-up an immobilised champion and apply all 6 stacks in the span of 0.5 seconds?  
So what?  
Samira didn't deserve those hard nerfs.

Samira is a skill-based champ that requires S-tier mechanics (see what i did there?), but now she’s barely even a champion.

If you don't believe me, then let’s hear what our resident UNSW LoL coach/manager has to say about Samira:

> _“Samira is the forefront of Riot's Champion Complexity Philosophy. She embodies high mechanical complexity requiring high APM and precise execution to decimate her enemies, high knowledge complexity to get that S-rank and elevate her damage, and high composition complexity requiring other players to significantly adapt their playstyle to play with or against Samira. Riot wants diversity in their champions and Samira needs to fit a niche that doesn't exist - high damage, great laning, good self peel, high mobility, great sustain, smooth combos, fast wave clear, decent poke and strong early, mid and late game. The nerfs take this identity away from her, leaving a void in the champion ecosystem.”_

“Hang on a second, why should we listen to stoopid midget hardstuck diamond thresh player?. What does he know about Samira?”. Well my primitive summoners, let’s get a word from our Unigames 2020 ADC who happened to main this glorious champion in her golden-age, Before Samira-nerf Era _(BSE)._

> _“Samira had a 49% prior to the nerfs and was highly dependent on all ins. Players could simply disrupt and one hit samira due to her playstyle hence why she was very feast or famine. Players were rewarded for learning combo streams and understanding damage values. Now the champion, even when played perfectly, under performs in the all in and can only play forward. The real question is: how to win?”_

So the question beckons: What is the way forward for our queen Samira? Will she ever become meta again? When will devs just go back to beating up Aphelios instead? Will shit ADCs in the botlane finally stop complaining for once? **_~~(just git gud)~~_**

Will Samira ever return back to her former glory?
