Dear Diary,

You know, life would have been _sooooo_ much easier if Renekton had just learnt to stay out of trouble. I mean, where did I go wrong? I played games with him, I gave him piggyback rides, I taught him how to make friends, I gave him all my favourite books to read in hopes that he’d share the same interests as me, but somehow he turns into this?

Ugh, there goes Mum again shouting at Renekton for, let me guess, getting into another street fight? Yep. Typical. Not even surprised anymore. Without listening, I can imagine _exactly_ how their conversation - well, shouting match - will go.

_“Again?! You went out to fight again?? Don’t you understand that you can get yourself killed one of these days?”_

_“Mum, I’m fine! Look! See? Perfectly healthy.”_

_“All I see are bruises, cuts, and scars. One more fight and I won’t even recognise your face anymore!”_

_“I know how to fight Mum, there’s nothing to worry about! It’s for fun!”_

_“Fun? You call this FUN?? Your body is a sacred gift from the sun-god, and you desecrate it like this? Do you understand the SHAME you bring to our family everytime they see you walk home like this? Your father doesn’t work his ass off everyday, just for you to tear all that reputation down!”_

_“Well maybe if he spent more time at home, I’d care more!”_

_“WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY, YOUNG MAN??? YOU ARE GROUNDED FOR THIS ENTIRE MONTH, YOU HEAR ME? NO GOING OUT! YOU WILL STAY HERE UNTIL YOU LEARN SOME MANNERS!”_

_“MAKE ME!”_

Every other day he’ll come back home bloodied and bruised, with one less tooth in his mouth. _Dear Renekton, I hope you know that while your ego can keep growing infinitely, your teeth certainly cannot_. Maybe he’ll finally understand when he starts slurping liquefied meat and vegetables for lunch.

Anyway, onto some good news - I’ve been accepted into the Collegium of the Sun! Hooray for me! Apparently they were highly impressed with the amount of volumes I have already read from the Library of the Sun, and were doubly stunned by the reviews and critiques I wrote. I also heard that the bookkeepers put in a good word for me which fast-tracked my application - _thanks guys_.

I’ll be moving out to their campus dormitory next summer, so only a few months left to go. I honestly don’t know what to expect once I get there - supposedly there’s a tradition for all the freshmen to introduce themselves at lunch on the cafeteria tables. Sounds like bogus to me, and just another way for the seniors to mess with us, but who knows, we’ll see when we get there.

Until then, I’ll have another couple of hundred volumes to keep me busy. Oh, yeah, Mum will also want me to keep an eye on Renekton. _Ugh_, he’s going to be an absolute nightmare to handle. Well, at least it’ll be one less thing to worry about once I move out.

Signing out for now,

  -Nasus

P.S. There’s going to be a _looooot_ of ladies at the Collegium. Don’t hate me if I miss a few days of writing!
